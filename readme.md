# Nick Golebiewski's Personal Page Project Part II

## Career Simulation

Four html pages:
- index.html
- about.html 
- portfolio.html 
- contact.html

Plus...
- readme.md 
- styles.css 

Things I learned...
- The mobile view looks really good streamlined!
- Again, start with design. It looks sloppy otherwise
- Styling forms
- nth-child

Things I am struggling with...
- mismatched overall design scheme from page to page from updating files from part I.
- profusion of CSS that could be simplified.
